--- DICOPT: Setting up first MIP
--- DICOPT: No NLP solution

      The NLP solver did not store a solution.
      DICOPT will terminate.

--- DICOPT: Could not solve relaxed NLP

      The relaxed NLP could not be solved. Please make sure
      the model solves as an RMINLP model.

--- DICOPT: Stopped prematurely because of Solver Failure

      DICOPT terminated prematurely because of a solver
      failure. The listing file will contain additional
      logs from the NLP and MIP solvers which may reveal
      what was the cause of the failure.

--- DICOPT: No solution

      No solution was found. There must have been an error.
